# **What is SquidVM?**

SquidVM is a Stack-based VM (just like _Java's JVM_).
It's made from the ground up using Rust for its implementation.

The VM will contain a programming language with the name Squid.

## What is a .sqdbin file?

It's the binary file that contains the instructions and data the VM will 
use to run your program!

Want to know more about the instruction set, stack and heap implemenation?

I'll probably make a simple wiki for that in some time! _Just wait for it._

## How to open .sqdbin files

* Execute the VM as normal, via the CLI `./squid-vm` (after using chmod +x of course).
* Put the binary path after the executable.

For example:
`./squid-vm testbinary.sqdbin`

Here ya go!

Hope it helps. : )
